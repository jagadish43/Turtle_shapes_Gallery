🐢 Python Turtle Graphics: Shape Drawing Program
-------------------------------------------------
📋 Project Overview
This Python project leverages the Turtle graphics module to create a fun and interactive program for drawing various geometric shapes. The user is prompted to input the shape they want to draw, and the program draws it on the screen using Turtle.

✨ Supported Shapes
--------------------
Circle
Triangle
Square
Rectangle
Pentagon
Hexagon
Star

💡 How It Works
----------------
When you run the program, it displays a list of supported shapes.
You input the name of the shape (case-insensitive), and the Turtle graphics will automatically draw it on the screen.
The screen window is set to stay in focus to enhance the drawing experience.

🛠️ Requirements
----------------
Python 3.x
turtle module (pre-installed in most Python distributions)

🔮 Future Improvements
-----------------------
Add support for more complex shapes (e.g., octagons, custom polygons).
Integrate a GUI for easier shape selection.
Enhance the color customization for the shapes.
